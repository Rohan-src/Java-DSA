This repository serves as my daily log for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms. This Repository contains my practiced questions on DSA and to track my progress as I am aimed at strengthing my problem-solving skills & preparation for technical interviews.

Most solutions are written in Java, as that is my primary language for Backend Development.

# Structured Repository
I have organised my code by topic wise so that it's easier to review it. You will mostly find folders like
        -> Arrays
        -> Linked list
        -> Trees
        ->Graphs 
        (& so on)


## About the Solutions
I stick to few rules when pushing code here:

1. Clean code: I will try to write variables names that make sense, not just a,b or x.
        
2. Comments: I add comments explaining the logic specially for tricky parts of recursive calls.

3. Complexity: I usually note down the Time and Space complexity at the top or at the bottom of the file.  


### My Goal

My goal is consistency, even if it's just one easy problem on a busy day. I want to keep the streak alive to build muscle memory for problem-solving.
